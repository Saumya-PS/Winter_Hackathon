# Round : 2 (Enhancement Plan)
This file lists the planned improvements for the project that will bw implemented in the upcoming rounds. The main focus should to improve automation,verification and make it practical for real-world deployment .

## 1. AI-Based Complained Classifcation
In next Rounds, Rule based complaint categorization will be further modified by ML models .

Planned improvements:
- To auto identify issue from text description and assign particular department.
- Image-based classification to detect common civic issues such as garbage, potholes, and water leakage
